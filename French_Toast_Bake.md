# French Toast Bake

## Ingredients

- 8 eggs  
- 1/2 cup brown sugar  
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon  
- 1/2 cup all‑purpose flour  
- 1/4 teaspoon salt  
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar  
- 2 tablespoons vanilla extract  
- 1 loaf sourdough bread, cubed  
- 1/2 cup butter  
- 1/2 cup heavy cream  
- 2 cups milk  

## Instructions

1. Grease a 9×13‑inch baking dish and fill it with the cubed sourdough bread.  
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, heavy cream, granulated sugar and vanilla until smooth. Pour the mixture evenly over the bread, pressing the cubes lightly so they absorb the liquid.  
3. Cover the dish and refrigerate overnight to allow the bread to fully soak up the custard mixture.  
4. In a separate bowl, combine the flour, brown sugar, cinnamon and salt. Cut in the butter with a pastry cutter or your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Cover and refrigerate this topping as well.  
5. When ready to bake, preheat the oven to **350°F (175°C)**. Sprinkle the crumb topping evenly over the soaked bread.  
6. Bake for about 45 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the center is set. Let the casserole stand for 5 minutes before serving. Serve warm, drizzled with maple syrup if desired.
