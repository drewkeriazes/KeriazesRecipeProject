# Sour Cream Coffee Cake

## Ingredients

### Cinnamon Topping

- 1/2 cup granulated sugar  
- 1/2 cup all‑purpose flour  
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon  
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted  

### Brown Sugar Filling

- 1 cup packed light brown sugar  
- 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon  
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg  
- 1 cup chocolate chips  

### Cake Batter

- 1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter, softened  
- 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar  
- 1/3 cup packed light brown sugar  
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract  
- 3 large eggs  
- 3 3/4 cups all‑purpose flour  
- 2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder  
- 3/4 teaspoon salt  
- 3/4 cup sour cream (or Greek yogurt)  
- 1/2 cup milk  

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to **350°F (175°C)**. Grease and flour a tube or Bundt pan.  
2. **Prepare the Cinnamon Topping:** In a small bowl, stir together the sugar, flour and cinnamon. Pour in the melted butter and mix until the topping resembles damp crumbs. Set aside.  
3. **Prepare the Brown Sugar Filling:** In another bowl, combine the brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and chocolate chips. Set aside.  
4. **Make the Cake Batter:** In a large mixing bowl, cream the softened butter with the granulated and brown sugars until light and fluffy. Beat in the vanilla extract, then add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.  
5. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt. In a third bowl, stir together the sour cream and milk.  
6. Add the dry ingredients to the creamed mixture alternately with the sour cream mixture, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Mix on low speed just until incorporated after each addition; do not overmix.  
7. Spread half of the batter evenly into the prepared pan. Sprinkle half of the cinnamon topping and half of the brown sugar filling evenly over the batter. Dollop the remaining batter over the top and gently spread it with a spatula. Sprinkle with the remaining cinnamon topping and brown sugar filling.  
8. Use a knife to gently swirl the layers together once or twice.  
9. Bake for 50–55 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean or with just a few moist crumbs.  
10. Allow the cake to cool in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Run a knife around the edge and center tube, then invert onto a plate. Invert again onto a serving plate so the crumbly topping is on top.  
11. Serve warm or at room temperature.
