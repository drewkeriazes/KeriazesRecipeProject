# Scones

## Ingredients

- 1 3/4 cups all‑purpose flour  
- 1/4 cup sugar  
- 2 teaspoons baking powder  
- 1/2 teaspoon salt  
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces  
- 1/3 cup craisins (or raisins)  
- 1/2 cup whole milk  
- 1 large egg  
- 2 tablespoons lemon zest  

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to **425°F (220°C)**. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease it.  
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt.  
3. Cut in the butter using a pastry blender or your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  
4. Stir in the craisins (or raisins) and lemon zest.  
5. In a small bowl, whisk together the milk and egg, reserving about a tablespoon to brush over the tops of the scones.  
6. Add the milk mixture to the dry ingredients and stir just until a soft dough forms; do not overmix.  
7. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead gently two or three times and pat into a 1‑inch thick circle.  
8. Cut the circle into wedges or rounds using a biscuit cutter or a knife. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet.  
9. Brush the tops of the scones with the reserved egg wash.  
10. Bake for 12–14 minutes, or until the scones are golden brown. Cool slightly on a wire rack before serving.
