# Breakfast Casserole II

## Ingredients

- 1 lb sausage, browned and drained  
- 1 package refrigerated crescent rolls  
- 1 cup cheddar cheese, grated  
- 5 eggs  
- 1/4 cup milk  
- Oregano, salt and pepper to taste  

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to **400°F (200°C)**. Grease a 9×13‑inch baking pan.  
2. Unroll and press the crescent roll dough evenly into the bottom of the prepared pan, pressing to seal seams.  
3. Sprinkle the cooked sausage evenly over the dough, followed by the shredded cheese.  
4. In a bowl, beat together the eggs, milk, oregano, salt and pepper. Pour this mixture evenly over the sausage and cheese layers.  
5. Bake for about 20 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the eggs are set. Allow to cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.
